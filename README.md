# About Me
Hi, I'm Ben! I'm a 'developer' from New Zealand. 
I'm a huge fan of all things Apple and have been since the day I was born, I'm also 100% addicted to The Legend of Zelda and Splatoon. Over the past few years I've learnt some coding language and made some cool stuff, I know HTML, CSS, Python and currently I'm learning Swift. 

Right now, I'm working on my first ever iOS and watchOS app called Grizzco Handbook, the ultimate companion for Salmon Run, which will be on the App Store soon! Anyway thanks for stopping by!
