# About Me
Hi, I'm Bella! I'm a 'developer' from New Zealand. 
I'm a huge fan of all things Apple and have been since the day I was born, I'm also 100% addicted to The Legend of Zelda and Splatoon. Over the past few years I've learnt some coding language and made some cool stuff, I know HTML, CSS, Python and currently I'm learning Swift. 

Currently I'm working on various iOS apps, [Splashcat](https://github.com/splashcat-ink/splashcat) and some Django web app doohickeys :)
